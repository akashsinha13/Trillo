# Trillo

This is a website template of online booking application, made while learning flexbox. This project has the purpose to show some Sass and CSS3 features and provide a ready template that could be adapted to any landing page we want.

## Requirement: 

* Node and NPM installed on machine. 

## Installation:

We can fork/git-clone the application into our local machine. Once that is done, install all the dependencies by running

```bash
npm install
```

## Build:

We can build the application by running 

```bash
npm install
npm run build:css
```

> When the build is complete, it will generate a style.css in the css/ folder, that we could use in our application.
